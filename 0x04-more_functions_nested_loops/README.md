# More Functions and nested loops
## 0-isupper.c
A function that checks for uppercase character. Program will return 1 if character is uppercase and 0, otherwise.
## 1-isdigit.c
A function that checks for a digit (0 through 9). Program will return 1 if character is a digit and 0, otherwise.
## 2-mul.c
A function that multiplies two integers.
## 3-print_numbers.c
A function that prints the numbers, from 0 to 9, followed by a new line. Limitations: The function putchar can only be used twice, and no standard library functions
## 4-print_most_numbers.c
A function that prints the numbers, from 0 to 9, followed by a new line. The numbers 2 and 4 are not printed. Limitations: The function putchar can only be used twice, and no standard library functions
## 5-more_numbers.c
A function that prints 10 times the numbers, from 0 to 14, followed by a new line. Limitations: The function putchar can only be used three times, and no standard library functions
## 6-print_line.c
A function that draws a straight line in the terminal. The user can input a number, n as an arguement and that is how many times the character _ will be printed. If n is 0 or less, then the function should print \n.
## 7-print_diagonal.c
A function that draws a diagonal line on the terminal. The user can input a number, n as an arguement and that is how many times the character \ will be printed. If n is 0 or less, then the function should print \n.
## 8-print_square.c
a function that prints a square, followed by a new line. The user can input a size, size as an arguement and that is the length and width of the square. The character # will be used to print the square. If size is 0 or less, then the function should print \n.
## 9-fizz_buzz.c
A program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100, followed by a new line. But for multiples of three print Fizz instead of the number and for the multiples of five print Buzz. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print FizzBuzz
## 10-print_triangle.c
A function that prints a triangle, followed by a new line. The user can input a size, size as an arguement, that will be the amount of space the base of the triangle will take. The character # will be used to print the triangle. If size is 0 or less, then the function should print \n.
